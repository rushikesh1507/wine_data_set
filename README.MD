 Prediction-of-Wine-Quality

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulfates
    Alcohol

## Run

```bash
python interface.py
```

## Data set 

The Dataset is  downloded from [wine quality csv file](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality)
